# Gaussian Distributions on Riemannian manifolds

[ a short intro, and a TL;DR ]

## The Gaussian distribution

[ definitions and so on ]

## An simple example: the circle

[ how sampling from the bivariate normal just simply won't lie on the circle. ]

<CircleAndLine />

## An idea: using a linear approximation

[ we can consider the tangent space of the circle at a given point. ]

[ the tangent space is just R, so we can build a uni-variate Gaussian there and take it from there. ]

[ but how do we project to the sphere? (What happens to usual projections?)]

## From the tangent space to the manifold

[ intuition: using the vectors as a way to know "how fast" we should be walking in the sphere ]

[ formalism: geodesics, uniqueness, IVPs. ]

[ This unique geodesic lets us define the exponential map. ]

## The push-forward of a random variable

[ Define the push-forward ]

## More examples: shpere and torus
