# A short essay about Cat's Cradle, by Kurt Vonnegut

*(to María del Rosario (a.k.a. Rochi) for telling me she'd be interested in this blogpost)*

I recently read Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle. Vonnegut thinks of it as one of his two best books (alongside Slaughterhouse-Five). Some of the conversations in the book very much reminded me of chats I've had with friends that are outside of Machine Learning, and in fields like Psychology, Philosophy, Literature or Media Studies... I would like to write a short essay about these (the conversations in the book and outside of it).
<!-- This essay contains major spoliers for the book, so feel free to stop here and give it a read if you're into parodies, commentary on science, religion, and politics. -->

The book tells the story of an unnamed writer (perhaps Vonnegut himself?) who is determined to write a book called *The Day the World Ended*, in which he'd give a factual account of what happened the day the first atomic bomb was dropped in Hiroshima. Rather than focusing on Japan, the book would focus on how the American scientists experienced this day. The author then starts by contacting the descendants of Dr. Felix Hoenikker, one of the fathers of the atomic bomb.

Dr. Hoenikker (a fictional figure, of course) had three children: Angela, Frank and Newton. Through letters from Netwon, the youngest, the author gets the following picture of Hoenikker's life:

> "I can remember cold mornings when Frank, Father, and I would be all in a line in the front hall, and Angela would be bundling us up, treating us exactly the same. Only I was going to kindergarten; Frank was going to junior high; and Father was going to work on the atom bomb."

> "I remember one morning like that when the oil burner had quit, the pipes were frozen and the car wouldn't start. We all sat there in the car while Angela kept pusing the starter until the battery was dead. And then Father spoke up. You know what he said? He said, 'I wonder about turtles.' 'What do you wonder about turtles?' Angela asked him. 'When they pull their heads,' he said, 'do their spines buckle or contract?'"

> Newton Hoenikker in Cat's Cradle, page 14 on the Kindle version, Kurt Vonnegut.

Chef's kiss. Even though Vonnegut's parody of a scientist is almost cliché (someone so brilliant they could build atomic bombs, yet completely unable to live as functioning adults), I still find it funny. It also seems to still be quite contemporary, though: [I was recently reading Quanta's profile of June Huh in which he shares that, during his postgraduate studies, he lived on nothing but frozen pizzas, and relied on stapled fabrics because the trip to the store was too logistically complex.](https://www.quantamagazine.org/june-huh-high-school-dropout-wins-the-fields-medal-20220705/) His wife also shares that she found him doing maths while she was in labor.

I appreciate Vonnegut's humor in portraying scientists a non-functioning adults, but I'm writing this blogpost for a different reason: the way he portrays how disconnected we seem to be of the potential consequences of our research. In this way, at least to Vonnegut's eyes, scientists are also naïve idiots.

In his quest to find out more about Dr. Hoenikker, the author goes to Ilium, the city where Hoenikker had worked. In particular, he scheduled an appointment with the vice-president of the research laboratory where Hoenikker had worked, Dr. Asa Breed. When he got to his office, though, he was hungover:

> I found that the public-relations centers of my brain had been suffocated by booze [...]. Every question I asked implied that the creators of the atomic bomb had veen criminal accessories to murder most foul.

> "All your questions seem aimed at getting me to admit that scientists are heartless, conscienceless, narrow boobies, indifferent to the fate of the rest of the human race, or maybe not really members of the human race at all."

> The author and Dr. Asa Breed, page 39 of Cat's Cradle, Kurt Vonnegut.

The conversation then tackles the types of projects that Dr. Hoenikker was suggested to work on. Dr. Breed says "People suggest things all the time, but it isn't in the nature of a pure-research man to pay any attention to suggestions." Nevertheless, it turns out that the military suggested Hoenikker to device a way to avoid mud:

> The author: "Mud?"

> Dr. Asa Breed: "The marines, after almost two-hundred years of wallowing in mud, were sick of it, [...] The general, as their spokesman, felt that one of the aspects of progress should be that Marines no longer had to fight in mud."

> A: "What did Dr. Hoenikker say?"

> Dr. AB: "[...] Felix suggested that there might be a single grain of something -even a microscopic grain- that could make infinite expanses of muck, marsh, swamp, creeks, pools, quicksand, and mire as solid as a desk. [...]"

> Dr. AB: "There are several ways in which certain liquids can crystallize -can freeze- several ways in which their atoms can stack and lock in an orderly, rigid way. [...] Suppose that the sort of ice we skate upon and put into highballs -what we might call ice-one- is only one of several types of ice"
