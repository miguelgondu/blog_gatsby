        <p>I'm Miguel Gonz√°lez Duque, a mathematician from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. I'm mostly interested in probabilistic modeling, focusing on Bayesian data analysis and its applications.</p>
        
        <p>I'm currently a PhD student at the <a href="https://game.itu.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Center for Computer Games Research</a> at the IT University of Copenhagen, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://sebastianrisi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sebastian Risi</a>. We are developing systems that automatically adapt to users, and we are applying these ideas on videogames and automatic difficulty adjustment.</p>
